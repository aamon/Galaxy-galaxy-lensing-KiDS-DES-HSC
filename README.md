# Galaxy-galaxy-lensing-KiDS-DES-HSC
Measurements from Amon &amp; Robertson 2023 using DES Y3, KiDS-1000 and HSC Y1

The DESY3KiDS1000_com_sys_mag signals include data systematic errors, a magnitude correction, 
and are already converted to the units quotes. 
For the invidual surveys, the notebook folds in systematic errors and converts the units!
It'll show you how to use the files, and make the following figures:
